				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>Based in beautiful Karlstad, Sweden, but often traveling. I help businesses, large and small, with solving problems through design. I design user interfaces, conduct research and even do a bit of coding when I get the chance.</p>
				<p>My education is in digital media design, focusing on systems development so I've got a pretty solid background in both the techie side as well as the human part and that's pretty much exactly where I can do the most good - where people meet technology.
				</p>
				<p>I've been working with digital solutions for about 7 years now, and while things are getting better, there is still much to be done in reducing the distance between people and technology we use every day.</p>
